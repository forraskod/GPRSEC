Debug mode on
The ~./gprsec/conn.log file will be made in a debug mode.\nIf your connect will not build up then please send us this file in your "Bugreport"!
Enable BCD Compress
Request that the peer compress packets that it sends, using the BSD-Compress scheme and agree to compress packets sent to the peer.\nIt's a real time comression function for data transmission!\nWARNING! IF YOU USE IT YOUR CONNECTION WILL BE ALWAYS SENDING AND RECIVING DATA FROM/TO THE SERVER\nEVEN THERE'S NO VALID DATA TRANSMISSION.\n(It's useful if you want to down(up)load a larger file. Don't forget about your limit(s) if you have that(those) using this funtion!\nSo you should turn off this function after the down(up)load!\nNote: While this funtion is active the conn.log file will be growing countinuously.)
The provider's APN (Access Point Name)
If the program has known the selected provider's APN,\nthen these will be shown in the next entry cell, if not, then the user has to give this name.\nBy the CDMA system networks no need to give the APN.

Status
Statistics
The server didn't give usable remote IP address. Usualy it means one or more of APN, username or password is/are bad. You should ask about those your provider's custumer service.
Very important!:\nIf you use a difficult theme the GPRS Easy Connect will use more system sources! Some available themes are not perfect, so you can get GTK error messages in the console (if you run program from there), which not means trouble for running of program.
Usable DNS IP(s) found in /etc/resolv.conf file:\n\n***\n***\n\nYou can overwrite this/these DNS(s) by DNS(s) known by GPRSEC, which is/are:\n\n***\n***\n\nFor the overwrite click "Yes", if you want to keep the current DNS(s) click "No"!\n(The file will be overwritten right now!)
Couldn't find usable DNS IP(s) in the /etc/resolv.conf file. You can use only dynamic DNS.
Information
[recommended]
The DNS numbers are not variable by user, the potential static DNS is red from /etc/resolv.conf. The dynamic DNS will be given by the provider after the successful connection and the program will use that/those.
\nIf APN list or connection scripts will be updated then this file will be copied into the user's home directory, from where GPRSEC is going to read and work with that.
There is no known DNS for this provider and there is no usable DNS in the /etc/resolv.conf file too.
You set static DNS earlier. Now it's turned to dynamic, because the earlier set DNS is not same it's provider's DNS certainly. If you want to use new static DNS for your newly selected provider, you need to select static DNS again!

This system lacks kernel support for PPP. This could be because the PPP kernel module could not be loaded, or because PPP was not included in the kernel configuration. If PPP was included as a module, try `/sbin/modprobe -v ppp'.  If that fails, check that ppp.o exists in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/net. See README.linux file in the ppp distribution for more details.
